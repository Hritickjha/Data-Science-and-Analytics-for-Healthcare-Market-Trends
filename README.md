- **Health care Data Analysis with Python/**: Jupyter Notebooks for data cleaning, transformation, and statistical analysis.
- **Dashboard Files (.PBI)**: Interactive Power BI dashboards for visual exploration of healthcare data.
- **Monitoring and Controlling/**: Documents for managing the implementation and tracking of project metrics.
- **Executing Folder/**: Project execution-related materials and scripts.
- **Final Presentation Slides/**: Summary of insights, visualizations, and project goals.
- **Final Report/**: Comprehensive report with appendix outlining the project workflow, methodology, and results.
- **Web App (PHP)**:
  - `admin/`, `doctor/`, `patient/`: Modules for user types.
  - `connection.php`: Backend DB connection logic.
  - `create-account.php`: User registration system.
  - `css/`, `img/`: Frontend styling and images of healthcare professionals.

## How to Run

1. **Python Analysis**:
   - Open Jupyter Notebook from the `Health care Data Analysis with Python` folder
   - Run each cell to load and analyze the data

2. **Power BI Dashboards**:
   - Open `.PBI` files using Power BI Desktop
   - Interact with slicers and charts to explore healthcare insights

3. **Web Interface**:
   - Host PHP files on a local or remote server with a database backend
   - Visit modules via browser (admin, doctor, patient)
